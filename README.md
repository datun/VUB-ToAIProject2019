# VUB - ToAIProject 2019
Project for "Techniques of AI" class of Masters in Applied Computer Science (MACS)

## Project Status:  :construction:

**S U S P E N D E D**
(Was suspended during internship, now suspended due to classes starting up.)

## Road Map

- [ ] Breaking hard coded blocks for modularity, functionality and ease to maintain.
- [ ] Scaling everything from two heaps to dynamic heaps.
- [ ] Better coding for tree generation, minimax generation etc.

## Small Introduction
**Project Subject:** "Implement a machine learning algorithm and proof to us that it works correctly".  
**Implementation:** Implementing minimax algorithm to a modified version of NIM game.

Game of NIM is chosen since:  
1. There are only two plays, a good play and a bad play.  
    This means that we can observe if everything is working correctly, algorithm will only make good plays. Else algorithm is not working correctly.  
    *This can be proved mathematically*
2. Every implementation of minimax algorithm is done on tic-tac-toe.  
    A variation of implementation will be nice to study and observe
